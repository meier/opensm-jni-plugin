Installation Instructions
*************************

A typical build scenario would be;

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make

if this fails, it would usually be due to not being able to find an Infiniband header file, or perhaps Java files.
Aliases to these unresolved links or includes can be created, or the build rules can be corrected.

Assuming everything "make"s, then you only need to install as root;

make install

it will output some important information, which is basically where everything is placed.  An example output;

	
	[root@siegfried OsmJpiInterface]# make install
	make[1]: Entering directory `/nfs/g0/meier3/ErisGit/OsmJpiInterface'
	test -z "/usr/lib" || mkdir -p -- "/usr/lib"
	 /bin/sh ./libtool --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c  'src/libOsmJniPi.la' '/usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.la'
	/usr/bin/install -c src/.libs/libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1 /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1
	(cd /usr/lib && { ln -s -f libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1 libOsmJniPi.so.1 || { rm -f libOsmJniPi.so.1 && ln -s libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1 libOsmJniPi.so.1; }; })
	(cd /usr/lib && { ln -s -f libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1 libOsmJniPi.so || { rm -f libOsmJniPi.so && ln -s libOsmJniPi.so.1.0.1 libOsmJniPi.so; }; })
	/usr/bin/install -c src/.libs/libOsmJniPi.lai /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.la
	/usr/bin/install -c src/.libs/libOsmJniPi.a /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.a
	chmod 644 /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.a
	ranlib /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.a
	PATH="$PATH:/sbin" ldconfig -n /usr/lib
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Libraries have been installed in:
	   /usr/lib
	
	If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
	in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
	specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
	flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
	   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
	     during execution
	   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
	     during linking
	   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
	   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
	
	See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
	more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	test -z "/usr/sbin" || mkdir -p -- "/usr/sbin"
	test -z "/usr/etc" || mkdir -p -- "/usr/etc"
	 /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 'etc/libOsmJniPi.conf' '/usr/etc/libOsmJniPi.conf'
	test -z "/usr/man/man8" || mkdir -p -- "/usr/man/man8"
	 /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 './man/OsmJniPi.8' '/usr/man/man8/OsmJniPi.8'
	make  install-data-hook
	make[2]: Entering directory `/nfs/g0/meier3/ErisGit/OsmJpiInterface'
	chmod 640 /usr/etc/libOsmJniPi.conf
	make[2]: Leaving directory `/nfs/g0/meier3/ErisGit/OsmJpiInterface'
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/nfs/g0/meier3/ErisGit/OsmJpiInterface'

Since this is installed in '/usr/lib' and the target host is almost always going to be a 64 bit system,
an alias may need to be created in /usr/lib64 that points to this library, so that opensm can find it.
As root;

cd /usr/lib64
ln -s /usr/lib/libOsmJniPi.so libOsmJniPi.so

As shown above, the configuration file is placed in "/usr/etc".  This file contains many settings
that are necessary for a successful installation.  Specifically, the location of JVM library must
be specified (location of libjvm.so), as well as the Java Options string which (amoung other things)
needs to provide the path to the JAR file.

The name and location of the LOG file is also specified in the configuration file.
